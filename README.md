## Service Essentials
Service Essentials help build complex, extensible applications. They do it by promoting service-oriented architecture, which decreases coupling, improves testability and reduces unwanted complexity.
More about the approach and its advantages in the [Service-Oriented Approach](https://github.com/avaneyev/ServiceEssentials/wiki/Service-Oriented-Approach) wiki section.

**Service Essentials include these basic building blocks:**
* [Service Locator](https://github.com/avaneyev/ServiceEssentials/wiki/Service-Locator) to register and find services in the application.
* [Data Request Service](https://github.com/avaneyev/ServiceEssentials/wiki/Data-Request-Service) to make network requests
* [Persistence Service](https://github.com/avaneyev/ServiceEssentials/wiki/Persistence-Service) to manage persistent data in Core Data storage.
